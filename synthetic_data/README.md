# Overview - Synthetic Data Sets
The purpose of synthetic data sets in the Data Model-Based Ingestion Pipeline is two-fold. First, good synthetic data sets allow us to quickly integrate tools for the ingestion pipeline and verify they meet our needs with data that resembles the expected data. Second, synthetic data allows us to check this data in to our repository and distribute it with the ingestion pipeline software. This second point enables using this data both to test in specific deployment environments and to use the synthetic data to develop our internal tests for the software.
