Welcome to the Data Model-Based Ingestion Pipeline (dm-bip) documentation!

Data Model-Based Ingestion Pipeline using LinkML tools

This project will coordinate the efforts of creating a Data Model-Based Ingestion Pipeline using LinkML tools. The goal is to create a set of tools that can be used to generate ingestion pipelines from a data model.
Currently this is a collaboration between the BioData Catalyst and INCLUDE teams with LinkML ideally the generalized framework will work for other environments. We welcome other groups joing the effort.
